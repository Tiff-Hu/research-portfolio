# Research Portfolio (Selected Projects)

This repository contains a small set of shareable projects that reflect my interests in statistical modeling, causal inference, NLP, and applied machine learning.  
Some research code is not public due to IRB/data-use or IP constraints; the projects here are included because they can be shared responsibly.

## Projects

### 1) Bayesian Analysis on Household Dietary Diversity (Tanzania)
Bayesian Poisson / Negative Binomial modeling of household dietary diversity, with prior comparison and sparsity-inducing feature selection (Lasso prior). Includes an end-to-end analysis write-up and reproducible code.  
Folder: `dietary-diversity-bayes/`

### 2) Text-based Financial Market Prediction
Pipeline to scrape and preprocess financial news / social content, generate NLP features (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings), and combine them with price data for predictive modeling (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest).  
Folder: `financial-text-market-prediction/`

### 3) U.S. Presidential Election Voting Predictors
Report-based analysis of demographic predictors and ensemble modeling approaches for voting behavior prediction.  
Folder: `voting-predictors/`
